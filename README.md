As the name implies, Phenix is a revival of a fairly old project I started in 2004.

The purpose today is to explore ideas around running queries on top of a relational database.

So for now it is mainly a toy project and a sandbox to test and learn.
Also I re-discovered the Test First methodology, now dubbed as TDD, as a exciting way to design code in a frugal way.
