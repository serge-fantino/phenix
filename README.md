As the name implies, Phenix is a revival of a fairly old project I started in 2004.

The purpose today is to explore ideas around running queries on top of a relational database.

So for now it is mainly a toy project and a sandbox to test and learn.
Also I re-discovered the Test First methodology, now dubbed as TDD, as a exciting way to design code in a frugal way.

## Update 1 (22/11/2019)

It seems that starting from scratch is a brilliant idea! and TDD is very helpful, on top of having 100% coverage. A huge breakthrough since the previous releases.

Now that I feel confident and see I can have good velocity by myself, I am for sure eager to push the limit and dream of a larger scope:
* adding JDBC support, zero commute
* adding visualisation
* ad-hoc analysis
* ...

Also at this early stage, I feel like adopting HexagonalArchitecture, mostly to keep the core part purely logical.
